;;; chop.el -- Interactive binary search for a line within a window.

;; Interactively-driven binary search to move the point to a
;; particular line on the screen, by successive choppings in half.

;; Setup:
;;
;; Bind chop-move-{up,down} to keys. Otherwise they probably won't
;; work right, since M-x mucks with `last-command'.

;; Instructions:
;;
;; Use the following algorithm to move to any visible line in O(log N)
;; steps for a window N lines high:
;;
;; 1. Choose a line, L.
;; 2. Press either UP or DOWN. This starts by moving the point to the center.
;; 3. Repeat until L is the current line (or close enough):
;;      If L is above the point, press UP. Otherwise press DOWN.
;;
;; In practice, a few chops usually gets you pretty close. Then you
;; can zero in with line/paragraph/defun-based motion.

;; Change history:
;;
;; 1.1: Uniform "chop-" namespace (you have to update your key bindings!)
;;
;;      Option to skip first step when starting from near the middle
;;      (chop-lines-near-middle)

;;      Autoload cookies

it.")
